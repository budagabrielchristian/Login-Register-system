# Login-Register-system
Create your account, or login if you have one! 

I have replaced multiple repeated lines of code with functions, as you may notice with the buttons and adding the accounts in the accounts Hashmap. This is currently nothing
but a small experiment of mine.

If you want to use it for logins only you can remove the register function and make a new JPanel of your own once you login, a new program perhaps..
